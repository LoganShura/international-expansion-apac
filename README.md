# APAC Market Entry Strategy — Wave-Based Expansion Model

## Overview
This project simulates an operator-style international expansion strategy for a fintech/SaaS business evaluating entry into APAC markets.

The objective was to structure ambiguity, quantify execution tradeoffs, and make a clear recommendation on **which markets to enter first — and why.**

## Core Question
**Which APAC markets should be entered first to maximize learning velocity while minimizing irreversible execution risk?**

## Key Deliverables
- **Weighted Market Scorecard (Excel)**  
  Evaluates Singapore, Australia, Japan, South Korea, and Hong Kong across execution-relevant factors including:
  - Regulatory Predictability  
  - Market Size  
  - Fintech Maturity  
  - Localization Effort  
  - Competitive Intensity  
  - GTM Complexity  
  - Growth Rate  

- **Executive-Style Strategy Deck (PDF)**  
  Synthesizes insights into a concise recommendation appropriate for Strategy / BizOps / Corporate Leadership audiences.

## Recommendation Summary
- **Wave 1 — Enter First:** Singapore & Australia  
  > High regulatory predictability and fast learning with manageable localization effort.

- **Wave 2 — Enter After Operating Muscle Is Built:** Japan & South Korea  
  > Attractive markets with higher localization and GTM execution requirements.

- **Monitor:** Hong Kong  
  > Strategically relevant, but evolving market conditions suggest observation before entry.

## Approach & Thinking
The analysis intentionally emphasizes **operator realities over theoretical upside**, including:
- Execution risk before market size  
- Learning velocity and repeatability  
- Sequencing to preserve optionality  
- Building capabilities across waves rather than “one-shot expansion”  

This reflects how strategy and BizOps teams assess expansion sequencing inside a real comp
